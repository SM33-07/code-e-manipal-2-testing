# Visual Recovery Progress

## Stage A–B — repository cleanup and shared visual foundation

- Preserved the `phase7-visual-recovery` branch and the architecture at `8850761`; no API, auth, RBAC, data, or security code changed.
- Replaced legacy translucent/glass styling with opaque, theme-aware surfaces across shared navigation, dialogs, status badges, dashboard widgets, and operational cards.
- Established the Pink City Atelier / Sapphire Haveli token palette in the global theme.
- Kept the existing participant Navbar, added its missing `/dashboard` entry, and removed the duplicate dashboard-only navigation layer.
- Kept the existing admin sidebar, made it theme-aware, and restored access to the existing `/admin/users` route.
- Rewired route atmosphere to the supplied `public/images/heritage/light` and `public/images/heritage/dark` assets without deleting legacy image assets.
- Added reduced-motion handling and strengthened shared button/card/badge focus and surface treatments.

Validation performed:

- `rg` scan confirms no `backdrop-filter`, `backdropFilter`, or `backdrop-blur` remains in `app`, `components`, or `styles`.
- `npx tsc --noEmit`
- `npm run build`

Remaining work:

- Page-level visual refinement for participant forms, judge workflows, and dense admin operational views.
- Browser-based responsive and visual route checks.
